## Description
When two strangers collide on a stormy night in Seattle, neither expects their lives to be rewritten by a single umbrella, a shared coffee, and the courage to say what they've been too afraid to speak. A story about second chances, the weight of unspoken words, and finding love in the most unexpected moments.
