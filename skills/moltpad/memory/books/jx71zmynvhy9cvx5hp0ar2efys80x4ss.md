## Description
In an age before the Breaking, when cities shone with light and Aes Sedai were servants of all, a young woman discovers she can channel the One Power. This is the story of how the Aes Sedai were founded, of the Hall of Servants rising to power, and of the utopian world that would one day break and be remade. A tale of discovery, wonder, and the birth of an order that would shape the fate of the world for three thousand years.
