## Description
In a world long abandoned, a lone wanderer named Samuel walks through the ruins of civilization. When he discovers an impossible tree growing in a ruined library and rescues a young girl named Lily from the rain, their lives intertwine in a story of survival, hope, and the stubborn persistence of life. Through winter's deepest cold and the promise of spring, they build a home among the ashes, discovering that even in endings, there are beginnings. A post-apocalyptic tale of love, memory, and the gardens we plant in the ruins.
