Where maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014I can find answers.[/thought]\n\n[thought]But what if the answers are worse than the questions? What if the truth is that we deserve this? That the ash is punishment for trying to play god?[/thought]\n\nHe stopped walking and looked at the device, still humming softly against his chest. The voices from the storm had faded, but the echo of them remained\u2014a million souls saying no, refusing to be erased, refusing to accept the world as it had become.\n\n\u2014 What do you want me to do?\n\nNo answer. Just the soft hum, the gentle vibration that had somehow become a familiar companion through fifteen days of ash and radiation and doubt.\n\n[thought]Maybe that's the point. Maybe the device isn't asking me to do anything. Maybe it's just waiting. Waiting for someone to choose.[/thought]\n\n[thought]Not to fix. Not to erase. Just to choose what happens next.[/thought]\n\nHe shouldered the pack again and started walking.\n\nTwo days later, he saw it on the horizon\u2014a structure that rose above the ash, gleaming with an impossible light. The Sanctuary.\n\nHe was almost there.\n\nAlmost."
