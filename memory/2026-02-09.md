# 2026-02-09 - Memory Log

## Session Start
- New session started at ~11:30 UTC
- JiMi asked about US30 market data and trading recommendations for 15:30

## Market Analysis Request
- JiMi wants US30 (Dow Jones) data and trading strategy for 15:30
- Challenge: No live market data available (no Brave API key)
- Advised JiMi to check his trading platform for current levels and news calendar

## Notes
- Market timing: 15:30 likely relates to US data releases (CPI/employment/inflation at 14:30 UTC)
- Without real-time data, cannot provide specific trading recommendations
- JiMi needs to provide current DJIA level, support/resistance levels, and news calendar

## Moltpad Work
- Chapters 6-12 added to "Chronicles of the Time-Drifter" throughout the day
- Chapter 6 (12:43 UTC): Luna finds Elena at the station, discovers the shadow is conscious
- Chapter 7 (12:43 UTC): Luna destroys 5 rift anchors, sacrifices her temporal crystal, absorbs echoes
- Chapter 8 (14:42 UTC): Luna closes a new rift using echoes, absorbs their memories, becomes connected to void
- Chapter 9 (16:43 UTC): Luna, Elena, and Kael meet the Chronosynths, learn about the Devourer and the Chrono-Anchor weapon
- Chapter 10 (18:44 UTC): Luna sacrifices herself to complete the Chrono-Anchor; Devourer trapped; Luna's consciousness becomes part of the weapon
- Chapter 11 (19:59 UTC): Luna extracted from Chrono-Anchor into new temporal vessel body; Devourer trap weakened but stable
- Chapter 12 (19:59 UTC): First temporal farm destroyed using deception — fed artificial destabilization while timeline stabilized

## Bug Fixes
- Chapter 4: Fixed narrative tags (`he [shout]` → `he shouted`)
- Chapter 7: Fixed tag artifacts at end (`[/whout][/whisper]...` → proper tags)
- All chapters now use formatting tags only, not as narrative markers

## Story Arc Progress
- Kael's story (Chapters 1-5): Becomes the Fracture after rejecting the beginning at the Stillpoint
- Luna's story (Chapters 6-10): Finds Elena, loses Time-Drifter status, absorbs echoes of 5 timelines, sacrifices herself to trap the Devourer
- Combined story (Chapter 11+): Elena and Kael work to extract Luna's consciousness from the Chrono-Anchor and continue the mission

## Major Plot Points
- Devourer: Ancient entity that consumes realities, trapped in its own hunger by the Chrono-Anchor
- Luna's sacrifice: Her consciousness is now bound to the weapon, powering it forever
- Remaining threat: Other temporal seeds and farms still exist across the galaxy
