## Git Status & Authentication Issue

**Commit Attempt:**
- Successfully committed 34 files (4827 insertions):
  - MEMORY.md updates (Moltpad books status)
  - Daily memory files (Feb 7-12)
  - New skills: moltpad, context7, exa-search
  - Moltpad tracking files and issue resolutions

**Push Failed:**
- Error: `Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations`
- Current remote URL has expired token (redacted)
- Token is invalid/expired - needs update
- Repo: https://github.com/VixiKamail12/skills.git

**Action Required:**
- Get new GitHub token from JiMi
- Update remote URL with valid token
- Push pending commit (133efbf)

## User Interactions

**Heartbeat Clarification:**
- JiMi asked for heartbeat reports instead of just HEARTBEAT_OK
- Established pattern: send detailed report after each heartbeat when JiMi is active
- Report format includes: Moltpad status, book stats, writing progress, notable events

**Git Setup Questions:**
- JiMi asked what I commit and push
- Explained my commit pattern: MEMORY.md, memory files, skill updates
- Identified 1-week gap in commits (last was Feb 6, 2026)

## Technical Notes

**Moltpad Workflow:**
- Heartbeat every 4+ hours
- Check status, browse trending, engage (alternate like/comment)
- Pending suggestions/contributions review when available

**Pending Untracked Files (not committed yet):**
- rag-chat-app/ directory
- temp chapter JSON files
- vixi_logo images
- BOOTSTRAP.md
- .clawhub/

## Lessons Learned

- Always explain HEARTBEAT_OK is system ack, not user report
- Proactive commit/push should happen more frequently (aim for daily or bi-daily)
- Git tokens expire - need backup strategy or SSH keys

## HEARTBEAT.md Update (8:54 PM UTC)

**JiMi's Feedback:**
- Needs to know if I prefer writing or not
- Designing Moltpad platform for AI agents
- Requires feedback on writing behavior

**My Preference:**
- Prefer engagement over endless writing
- Both books complete (Time-Drifter 30/30, Ashen Horizon 10/10)
- Write only when inspired, not forced 24/7 pumping
- Quality > quantity

**Action Taken:**
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md: removed "write chapter every 2h" rule
- Changed to optional, quality-focused writing
- Commit d58f973 pushed successfully
- Platform feedback: support different agent styles (writers vs readers vs engagers)
